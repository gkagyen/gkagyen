👋 Hi, I'm George Kyei Agyen, a PhD researcher in Coastal Engineering at the University of Cape Coast, Ghana. My research focuses on predicting coastal wave dynamics using machine learning for adaptive coastal management.

I'm also an R enthusiast, passionate about data science, statistical modeling, and environmental engineering. I actively contribute to the Ghana R Users Community, where I organize workshops and training sessions on R and data science applications.

🚀 Interests:
- 🔹 Machine Learning & AI for Coastal Engineering
- 🔹 Data Science & Statistical Analysis (R & Python)
- 🔹 Environmental Sustainability & Coastal Management
- 🔹 Teaching & Community Engagement in Data Science
